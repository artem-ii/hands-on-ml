This seems to work much slower than a for loop

Also I'm stillconfused with how all the predictions differ with what
is shown in the book although using the seed.

# %%%% Skewed data

'''

The code below demonstrates that in a highly skewed dataset if you always
predict one of the categories, you get very high accuracy â€” i.e. about 10%
of the dataset is represented by fives.
Hence the accuracy of "Never5Classifier"

'''
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator

class Never5Classifier(BaseEstimator):
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # Does nothing during training
        pass
    def predict(self, X):
        # returns a zero array of the X length
        return np.zeros((len(X), 1), dtype=bool)
    
never_5_clf = Never5Classifier()
cross_val_score(never_5_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, scoring="accuracy")

'''

Out[107]: array([0.91125, 0.90855, 0.90915])

"accuracy" is not the best performance metric,
especially for the skewed datasets

'''

# %%%% Confusion matrix

'''

This problem may be addressed by using a confusion matrix.
It computes how often a model confuses each class with another class.

'''

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict

y_train_pred = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3)

'''

This is similar to cross_val_scores, but returns predictions
of a model from cross-validation evaluation

'''

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

confusion_matrix(y_train_5, y_train_pred)

'''

Out[118]: 
array([[53892,   687],   <<< non-fives (negative class)
       [ 1891,  3530]])  <<< fives (positive class)
   correct^^^    ^^^incorrect predictions
Each row is an actual class, and each column is a predicted class
[1, 1] are true negatives, [2, 1] are false positives
[1, 2] are false negatives, [2, 2] are true negatives

A perfect confusion matrix looks like this

'''

y_train_perfect_predictions = y_train_5
confusion_matrix(y_train_5, y_train_perfect_predictions)

'''

array([[54579,     0],
       [    0,  5421]])
A perfect prediction matrix has non-zero values only on the main diagonal.

'''

# %%%% Precision & Recall

'''

Precision is a more concise metric based on confusion matrix.
It is calculated as follows:
    TP / (TP + FP)
(where TP is true positive etc)

Recall
or Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR) is used together with precision:
    TP / (TP + FN)
